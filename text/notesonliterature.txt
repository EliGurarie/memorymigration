- Goal: ecological conditions under which migration should "Evolve"
- Evolutionary IBM based model 
- Separates Resource / Historical / Social (similar to us) ... but no fitness or selection
- OUR WORK IS UNIQUELY PATCHY - non-connected  ... migration only POSSIBLE strategy, but it can develop even WITHOUT selection / evolution.

IBMs have shown that a collective aspect is important for the evolution of migration (Guttal and Couzin, Shaw and Couzin).  In these models, however, the main mechanism of migration is a resource followign behavior.
