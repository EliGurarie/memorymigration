\title{Run Many Runs for a set of parameters}
\usage{
runManyRuns(
  parameters.df,
  resource_param,
  world,
  resource,
  filename = NULL,
  results.dir = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters.df}{data frame with combination values of parameters. These are \code{epsilon} - diffusion coefficient; 
\code{alpha} - forage following coefficient; \code{beta} - strength of sociality; \code{lambda} - 
spatial sclae of sociality; \code{kappa} - propotion of reference versus working memory}

\item{resource_param}{data frame with combination values of parameters for resource. These values will be passed through 
the getCCPars function. These are mu_x0 (spatial coordinate of resource peark for summer), mu_t0 (timing of 
resource peak for the summer), beta_x (rate of change of peak location), beta_t (rate of change of peak timing), 
n.years (how many years the resource should be created), sigma_x (spatial scale of resource pulse), 
sigma_t (time duration of resource pulse), psi_x (standard deviation of peak location),  
psi_t (standard deviation of peak timing), n.years.null (how many years the resource remains stable i.e.
no drift or stochasticity).}

\item{world}{world object; list of 7: a population distribution across the time period in a T x X matrix,
a vector with midpoint X-values, the time points for the population as integers 1:tau, the minimum value of population distribution
(X.min), the maximum value of population distribution (X.max),
the dx value and the tau value. Can incorporate resource attribute into the world to make a list of 8.
Set up by the getSinePop/getOptimal function. 
@param resource string of either "island" or "drifting" to indicate the type of resource}

\item{filename}{string containing base name of the file to be created}

\item{results.dir}{string containing directory of where results from the R scripts will be stored}
}
\value{
data frame of indices and information about each simulation run
}
\description{
Based on a migratory population's set up (the World) and the values \code{alpha},
\code{beta0} and \code{beta1}, this function determines the population 
distribution after several years for many runs of the population and the resource.
